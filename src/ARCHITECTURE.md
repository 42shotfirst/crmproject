# CRM Application Architecture

## Overview

This document outlines the architecture of the CRM application, including its structure, key components, and design principles.

## Directory Structure

The application follows a feature-based directory structure:

```
src/
  ├── features/           # Feature modules
  │   ├── auth/           # Authentication feature
  │   ├── contacts/       # Contact management feature
  │   ├── dashboard/      # Dashboard feature
  │   ├── calendar/       # Calendar and scheduling feature
  │   ├── documents/      # Document management feature
  │   ├── payments/       # Payment processing feature
  │   └── reports/        # Reporting feature
  │
  ├── shared/             # Shared utilities and components
  │   ├── components/     # Reusable UI components
  │   ├── hooks/          # Custom React hooks
  │   ├── utils/          # Utility functions
  │   ├── types/          # TypeScript types and interfaces
  │   └── constants/      # Application constants
  │
  ├── lib/                # External library integrations
  │   ├── supabase.ts     # Supabase client configuration
  │   └── utils.ts        # General utility functions
  │
  ├── App.tsx            # Main application component
  ├── main.tsx           # Application entry point
  └── index.css          # Global styles
```

## Core Design Principles

### 1. Feature-Based Modularity

The application is organized around business features rather than technical concerns. Each feature is a self-contained module with its own components, hooks, and utilities.

### 2. Clear Component Interfaces

Components have well-defined props interfaces and documentation. This ensures they can be reused and composed effectively.

### 3. Separation of Concerns

The application separates:
- **UI Components**: Responsible for rendering and user interaction
- **Data Management**: Handled through hooks and context
- **Business Logic**: Encapsulated in services and utilities

### 4. Consistent Patterns

The application uses consistent patterns for:
- State management
- Data fetching
- Form handling
- Error handling
- Component composition

## Key Architectural Components

### Feature Modules

Each feature module follows a consistent structure:

```
feature-name/
  ├── api/            # API integration for the feature
  ├── components/     # UI components specific to this feature
  ├── hooks/          # Custom React hooks for the feature
  ├── types/          # TypeScript interfaces and types
  ├── utils/          # Utility functions
  ├── context.tsx     # Feature-specific context (if needed)
  └── index.ts        # Public API exports
```

### Shared Components

Reusable UI components that are used across multiple features. These components are designed to be:

- **Generic**: Not tied to specific business logic
- **Composable**: Can be combined to build complex UIs
- **Accessible**: Following WCAG guidelines
- **Responsive**: Working across different screen sizes

### Data Flow

The application follows a unidirectional data flow:

1. **State Management**: Using React's Context API and hooks
2. **Data Fetching**: Custom hooks for API integration
3. **UI Updates**: Components react to state changes

### Authentication and Authorization

The application uses Supabase for authentication and implements role-based access control:

- **Authentication**: Handled by Supabase Auth
- **Authorization**: Role-based permissions
- **Protected Routes**: Components that restrict access based on user roles

## Extension Points

The application is designed to be extensible through:

1. **Plugin System**: For adding new features or customizing existing ones
2. **Custom Fields**: For extending data models
3. **Theming**: For customizing the look and feel
4. **API Hooks**: For integrating with external services

## Performance Considerations

1. **Code Splitting**: Features are loaded on demand
2. **Memoization**: Components and calculations are optimized
3. **Virtualization**: For rendering large lists efficiently
4. **Lazy Loading**: For non-critical components and assets

## Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Tests**: For individual components and utilities
2. **Integration Tests**: For feature modules
3. **End-to-End Tests**: For critical user flows
4. **Accessibility Tests**: To ensure WCAG compliance

## Deployment and CI/CD

The application uses a modern CI/CD pipeline:

1. **Automated Testing**: On every pull request
2. **Static Analysis**: For code quality and security
3. **Preview Deployments**: For reviewing changes
4. **Production Deployment**: After approval

## Future Considerations

1. **Internationalization**: Support for multiple languages
2. **Offline Support**: Progressive Web App capabilities
3. **Mobile Apps**: React Native versions
4. **Advanced Analytics**: For user behavior tracking
5. **AI Integration**: For intelligent features
