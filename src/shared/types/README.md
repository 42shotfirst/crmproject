# Shared Types

This directory contains TypeScript types and interfaces that are used across multiple features in the application.

## Available Types

- `common.ts`: Common utility types
- `api.ts`: API-related types
- `ui.ts`: UI-related types

## Type Guidelines

1. **Naming**: Use PascalCase for interfaces and types
2. **Documentation**: Include JSDoc comments
3. **Organization**: Group related types in appropriate files
4. **Consistency**: Follow consistent patterns for similar types

## Creating New Types

When creating new types:

1. Determine if they belong in an existing file or need a new one
2. Follow the established naming conventions
3. Include proper documentation
4. Consider using TypeScript features like generics, unions, and intersections
